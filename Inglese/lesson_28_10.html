        <b>Past Tenses (Simple, Continous, Perfect, Perfect Continous):</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Past Perfect</b>: When the second action chronologically come
            first in a sentence or series of phrases (Examples:
            <i
              >When I <u>arrived</u> home, I noticed that my wallet
              <u>had</u> been stolen; He <u>accused</u> John of stealing the
              car, but later <u>realized</u> that he
              <u>had only forgotten</u> where he <u>had parked</u> it</i
            >; Before studying abroad last year, David
            <u>had been studying</u> French for seven years);
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Past Simple + Past Continous</b>: simultaneous actions -> one
            action that was in progress (PC) when another action interrupted it
            (PS). Often coordinated with <u>While</u> or <u>When</u> (Examples:
            <i
              ><u>While</u> he was walking home from school, a dog attacked him;
              He was walking home from school <u>when</u> a dog attacked him;
              <u>When</u> Jane came home from the office, John cooked/was
              cooking/had cooked/had been cooking dinner;)</i

        <b>Describing Past Habits:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            "Used to" + base form (strictly about facts that happened regularly
            or repeatedly in the past but don't happen now. In the negative, the
            action or state was not true in the past but is true in the present.
            It can be with any verb) (Examples:
            <i
              >She used to work at Google; he didn't use to live so far away;
              Did he use to have long hair? Yes, he did/ No, he didn't;</i
            >);
          </li>
          <li>
            "Would" + base form (also conveys an idea of enjoyment and
            nostalgia; it can't be used for states) (Examples:
            <i
              >When I was a child, I would stay at my grandparents' farm all
              summer);</i
