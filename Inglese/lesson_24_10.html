    <ul style="font-size: large">
      <li>Let's start with Present Perfect (Simple);</li>
      <li>Form: "have" + past participle;</li>
      <li>Example: "I've' done something good";</li>
      <li>
        We use it for:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Indeterminate past actions, finished action in the past, time not
            specified(Example: "I have been to Spain before/I 've never been to
            Spain before/Have you evere been to Spain before?");
          </li>
          <li>
            Recently finished actions with an effect on the present. It's used
            with adverbs like "just", "already" and "yet" (Example: "I've just
            finished my work/I've already finished it/I haven't eaten
            yet/Haven't you eaten yet?");
          </li>
          <li>
            Duration: actions started in the past that continue in the present.
            It uses words like "for"(quantitiy of time, two weeks, etc.),
            "since" (moment in time, two years ago, ten minutes ago, since I was
            a child) and "but" ("I played Tennis for 10 years <u>but</u> I've
            stopped because I broke my wrist") (Example: "<u>How long</u> have
            you studied English?/I've studied English for 12 years/I've studied
            English <u>since</u> I was in middle school")
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The expression of time is ALWAYS put at the end of the sentence;</li>
      <li>
        Use "Past Simple" for finished actions when the time
        <u>is</u> specified;
      </li>
      <li>
        Present Perfect (Continous) = "have been" + -ing; it is used when:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Depends on the source of the present effect;
            <ul>
              <li>
                Effect from the action itself (Example: "I'm not hungry because
                I've already eaten");
              </li>
              <li>
                Effect from duration of action (Example: "I'm tired because I've
                been shopping all-day");
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Effects from the action</li>
          <li>
            Duration of actions (Example: "I've been living in Italy since
            2006/They've been playing football for 16 years/But they've known
            each other for 2 months");
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        "Hi Claire Thanks for the photos of your trop to Nice. I've never been
        there. Have you ever been to Scotland? I went there last summer and it
        was amazing! I've never seen such beautiful scenery. We climbed
        mountains and walked around huge lakes that the Scottish people call
        lochs. Have you ever heard of the tale of the Loch ness monster? See you
        soon, Marie"

        "Have you always hated fish? Thanks for the recipes. We've tried two
        different recipes so far. I'm worried about Sam. She's been working too
        hard recently. I've been trying to call the Internet provider all
        morning, but I can't get trough"
